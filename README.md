# Dijkstra Pathfinding Visualizer

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dijkstra Pathfinding Visualizer! This web application allows you to interactively visualize the Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The front-end of this application is built using Vite and React, with a visually appealing CSS design to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Dijkstra Algorithm:** The core functionality of this visualizer is based on the Dijkstra algorithm, a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.


- **Start and End Nodes:** Specify the start and end nodes for the algorithm to find the shortest path between them.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Watch the algorithm in action with a step-by-step visualization.
